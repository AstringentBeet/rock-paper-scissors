# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## The Gist of It
Honestly, there's no need to have this file, as RPS is a pretty common exercise
among many newbies such as myself. Nonetheless, I consider it somewhat important
to get into the habit of explaining each project as thoroughly as possible. 

Since it has been quite a while since I have made an update, I might as well treat this
like a brand new project. There'll be a few more changes down to this demo.

Who knows where this'll end up. I initially wanted to make this into a fighting game,
but that may take time away from my other goals...again, we'll see.

## My Process
The initial step is to, at the very least, change the God-awful text that I initially entered those years ago.
Besides that, here is the overall outline of my plan:
- removing the prompt/alert box in favor of actual buttons and a more dynamic GUI.
- adding more animation, including an introduction from a character from a Haruki Murakami's 'Kafka on The Shore'.
 - Everytime the user goes to a different tab, either an event will take place, or a new character will replace the previous one (in an orderly fashion...initially).
 - This is where a lot of my time will be spent, but it'll pay off.
- condesnsing the lines of code.
- redesigning the layout by going over the faulty, apparently non-responsive grid-layout of the page.

## Progress Log

#### 03/28/2022
CLoned the repository; the goal is to create a more GUI-freindly variation of the game.
I may try to reduce the lines of code in this game as well. Goodbye, prompts, hello, buttons!


## What I learned
Yeah...
